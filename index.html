    <h2>Summary</h2>

    (your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why.
    Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her
    passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the
    workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
    learning new things from everywhere etc.).

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, version control, tools etc.)

    <h2>Code examples</h2>
    (LATEST)

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
    freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
    Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)

    <h2>Education </h2>
    (including courses, seminars, lectures, online learning)

    <h2>English</h2>
    (elaborate on what kind of practice you had, if any, how long it lasted and so on)
